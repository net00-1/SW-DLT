# SW-DLT

SW-DLT ("Shortcuts Wrapper for -DL Tools") is an iOS shortcut that allows you to easily use, install and manage the popular and open source utilities [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [`gallery-dl`](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl). This shortcut aims to be compatible with [`yt-dlp's`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md) & [`gallery-dl's`](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/blob/master/docs/supportedsites.rst) collections of supported websites.
